## How to Contribute:

### Basics:
- All contributors have read-only permissions. To contribute, please fork the repository into a personal fork such as https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs/HY_Features and submit changes as a pull request. After review, Dave Blodgett or other contributors who are given merge rights in the future will merge the changes. 
- Please make an initial commit shortly after starting to edit a part of the spec and open a pull request with a note that you are in progress. This will help others know that you are actively working.  
- There are a variety of tools to use to edit the draft materials either online or using a local clone of the repositories. The easiest is to edit the markdown source in your personal fork on github.
