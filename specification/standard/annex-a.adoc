== Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

[NOTE]
Ensure that there is a conformance class for each requirements class and a test for each requirement (identified by requirement name and number)

[#annexA_1]
=== Introduction

These test suites ascertain the compliance of the conformance targets for the HY_Features specification with the specification itself. Each instance of hydrologic feature data is encoded according to a specific interchange schema, so the role of conformance with the abstract specification is that such an implementation schema can be related to the common definitions of HY_Features.
An implementation schema conforming to HY_Features SHALL provide a formal mapping from one or more Feature Types present in the implementation schema to Feature Types defined in this standard specification, including all mandatory properties defined by the realized HY_Features concept. Default values to be assumed must be specified in this mapping.
