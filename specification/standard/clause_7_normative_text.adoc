=== The HY_Features conceptual model

This standard defines the HY_Features conceptual model as a standard for the identification and description of hydrologic features reflecting both hydrologic significance and topological connectivity of hydrologic features. HY_Features formalizes the fundamental relationships between components of the hydrosphere. It describes the hydrosphere as a hierarchical network of hydrologically connected catchments, their organization in networks of catchments and/or waterbodies, and their various visual and topological realizations.

Core concepts of HY_Features are: 1) an abstract idea of 'catchment' witch has many possible 'realizations', 2) upstream - downstream catchment topology and nested hierarchy, 3) aggregation of networks of watercourses within catchment networks, and 4) linear referencing along a river using a nominal main flow path. The single concept that governs HY_Features is that any place on the land surface can be thought of as the outfall of a corresponding catchment and be placed into a hydrologic topology of connected, often named, hydrologic features.

The conceptual model is implemented in several discrete modules. It is intended that implementations of the conceptual model need to consider only those parts of the model required. An implementation may include or exclude feature properties, or allow cardinality of one or more associations to be ‘nillable’. Table 1 lists the application schemas, the leaf packages included and the concepts reflected therein.

The conceptual model is expressed in the Geographic Information Conceptual Schema Language (ISO 19103:2005) based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The organization into packages and package dependencies are shown in link:#figure16[Figure 16]. The following sections describe requirements classes for each application schema, whereby each feature addressed in the requirements shall be understood as an instance of the GF_FeatureType (aka FeatureType) «metaclass». For the purpose of consistency with the conceptual UML model the British spelling of feature type names and properties has been adopted.

=== The HY_Features conceptual conformance (mapping)

The HY_Features model is a 'conceptual model', not intended to be directly implementable for data exchange or persistence. The conformance target of the HY_Features model is therefore a logical model of an implementation that encodes aspects of the HY_Features model. 

Conformance to the HY_Features model is a matter of being able to unambiguously identify what elements of an implementation schema map to the HY_Features model, and inclusion of all mandatory properties of the defined Feature Types in such mappings. 

The HY_Features conceptual model provides the basis for determining whether two references to hydrologic features are references to the same feature. i.e. to specify the real world type of features independent of their implementation or format. More specifically, it provides the means to distinguish between the reference concept (e.g. a catchment) and its realizations as geographic features (e.g. flowpath, catchment area or boundary), and hence to declare that different realizations share common hydrological connectivity. 

Disparate systems describing hydrologic features may be mapped to the equivalent HY_Features definitions to disambiguate the local usage of terminology and specific implementation choices made. 

Note that a direct encoding of HY_Features to an implementation format such as RDF may be implemented through annotation or direct correspondence of names to the HY_Feature elements.

include::requirements/req01.adoc[]

An implementation schema conforming to HY_Features SHALL provide a formal mapping from one or more Feature Types present in the implementation schema to Feature Types defined in this standard specification, including all mandatory properties defined by the realized HY_Features concept. Default values to be assumed must be specified in this mapping.
