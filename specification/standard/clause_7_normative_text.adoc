=== The HY_Features conceptual model

This standard defines the HY_Features conceptual model as a standard for
the identification and description of hydrologic features reflecting
both hydrologic significance and topological connectivity of hydrologic
features. HY_Features formalizes the fundamental relationships between
components of the hydrosphere describing the hydrosphere as a
hierarchical network of hydrologically connected catchments, the various
realizations a catchment may have and the organization of catchments,
waterbodies or channels in networks.

The single concept that governs HY_Features is the hydrologically
determined union of a catchment and its hydro nexus: any place on the
land surface can be considered the hydro nexus of a corresponding
catchment. Catchments and hydro nexuses together form the basis of
networks of connected, usually named, hydrologic features. Other core
concepts of HY_Features are: 1) an abstract idea of 'catchment' which
has many possible geometric and/or topological feature realizations, 2)
catchments realized as networks of waterbody features, and 3) linear
referencing of river positions using a nominal main flowpath.

The conceptual model elements are grouped into three modules. A model
implementation may include any or all feature concepts included in any
module, include or exclude feature properties, and allow changing
cardinality of one or more associations to 'nillable', expressing that
these logically exist but are not realized in a particular
implementation. Table 3 lists the modules, the leaf packages included in
each, and the concepts reflected therein.

The conceptual model is expressed in the Geographic Information
Conceptual Schema Language (ISO 19103:2005) based on the Unified
Modeling Language (UML). The organization of the HY_Features hydrology
model classes into modules, packages, and dependencies is shown in
Figure 20.

=== HY_Features conceptual model conformance

include::requirements/req01.adoc[]

The HY_Features model specified in this standard is a 'conceptual
model', and not intended to be directly implementable for data exchange
or persistence. The conformance target of the HY_Features model is
therefore either an implementation schema that implements concepts
defined in the HY_Features model, or a schema mapping that maps between
disparate existing feature types by means of common HY_Features
concepts.

The feature types in the HY_Features conceptual model are defined below
according to the modules and leaf packages described above into which
their UML classes have been grouped.

=== Hydro Feature concepts

The HydroFeature application schema provides the core concepts of a named hydrologic 
feature in the Named Feature (shown in Yellow) of a hydrologic complex.
For each complex, the union of catchment and its common outlet is realized by a collection of hydrologic features (shown in Blue) and
a river referencing system, which allows placement of an arbitrary
feature 'along a river' using linear referencing (shown in Green) along
a one-dimensional topological flowpath realization.

[#figure21]
.Hydro Feature Application Schema Diagram
image::figures/fig21.png[]

If required, an implementation should use terms from the code lists in
Annex B of this standard, defined specifically to conform to a
terminology common in the hydrology domain. Note that alternative code
lists may be used but should be related to the terms in Annex B.4 using an appropriate formalism.

[#figure22]
.Hydro Feature â€“ external dependencies
image::figures/fig22.png[]

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific
instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General
Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked
through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of
hydrologic information.

As an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is
identified by a unique identifier and typical properties. Typically, a
hydrologic feature is additionally identified through names in common
usage and through hydrologically significant characteristics.

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is specialized into more specific
feature types, which specify additional properties and represent
particular hydrologic phenomena (link:#figure23[Figure 23]).

[#figure23]
.Hydrologic features describing separate aspects of hydrology phenomena
image::figures/fig23.png[]

The definitions of HydroFeature feature types are rooted in the
definitions documented in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology. They are
applied regardless of their application context in respect to the
Earth's surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the
HY_Features conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology,
the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A
conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the
groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2:
Part 4 - GroundwaterML2 standard link:#OGC2016[[6\]].

Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between
hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a
consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various
spatial or temporal representations.**

==== The Named Feature model

The Named Feature model (link:#figure24[Figure 24]) defines the
HY_HydroFeature type as a basic feature to reflect the properties 
that all hydrologic features have, such as names in cross-jurisdictional 
and multi-lingual contexts. The HY_HydroFeature type has one association: _name_.

The HY_HydroFeatureName type provides a pattern to handle cultural,
political and historical variability of names. This supports the
assignment of a referenceable name for all or parts of a hydrologic
feature without necessarily having a formal model for the naming.

[#figure24]
.Named Feature (UML class diagram)

HY_HydroFeatureName carries five attributes: _name_, _namesPart_,
_preferredBy_, _usage_ and _variantSpelling_.

|=======================================================================

==== The Hydro Complex Model

The Hydro Complex model describes a collection of hydrologic features that
form a hydrologically closed system. This includes the catchment, its
inflow and outflow (conceptualized as hydro nexuses) as well as various
realizations of catchment and hydro nexuses by typical hydrologic
features. In this complex, the union of catchment and its common outlet
determines the topological closure of an abstract catchment and its
inflow and outflow hydro nexuses. The catchment topology pattern, which
could, be expressed as a flowpath bounded by inflow and outflow nodes,
is then applied to realize the connectivity in hydrographic networks,
channel networks, or hydrometric networks.

The Hydro Complex model also allows catchments to be recognized through
reference to a hydro nexus even if stream networks, catchment areas or
catchment boundary are not available. It is intended that hydrological
reporting applications may use this model without the full complexity
and detail of scientific catchment models.

===== Catchment

The Catchment model conceptualizes the hydrologic determination of a
catchment through inflow and outflow hydro nexus features with the role
of getting flow from a contributing catchment, or providing inflow to a
receiving catchment (link:#figure25[Figure 25] and link:#figure26[Figure 26]).
Conceptually, each catchment has an outflow hydro nexus, and any hydro nexus 
has a corresponding catchment, even if catchment and/or hydro nexus may 
not be present in a particular application. A catchment interacts with 
upper and lower catchments via associated hydro nexuses, and ultimately
contributes flow to the hydro nexus of a containing catchment. The
catchment should be understood as the logical link between two hydro
nexuses.

[#figure25]
.Catchment model (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig25.png[]

The HY_Catchment feature type captures the union of catchment and hydro
nexus, and the multiple realizations of the holistic catchment concept.
These realizations include both topological realizations, as well as
their geometric representation. HY_Catchment may be further specialized
with respect to catchment interaction.

The HY_Catchment feature type (link:#figure26[Figure 26]) specializes the 
general HY_HydroFeature type. Through generalization, HY_Catchment inherits 
the _name_ property. It carries a _code_ attribute and the associations:
_outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_,
_conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_,
_catchmentRealization_.

boundary, and contributing together with these to a single, common hydro
nexus. This internal boundary may be a divide separating adjacent
catchments, or a diffused divide between non-delineated sub-catchments
within an encompassing catchment, or a fictive boundary between distant
catchments. A dendritic network of catchments provided, where each
catchment is determined by its single outflow, this association can be
used to summarize diffused inflow into a catchment, as typical for
headwater catchments, or spread outflow occurring for example in estuary
catchments. |Association

===== Catchment Aggregate

The HY_CatchmentAggregate feature type (link:#figure30[Figure 30]) 
specializes the HY_Catchment type as a set of non-overlapping dendritic 
and interior catchments arranged in an encompassing catchment. This can 
be used to describe multiple inflows into a catchment aggregate through 
several hydrologically discrete sub-catchments each with a single inflow, 
and contributing to a joined outflow of the catchment aggregate, including
the 'nillable' outflow of interior catchments. Nillable is meant here to
signify that the hydro nexus logically exists in the form of flow to the
subsurface or atmosphere but is unknown in a given implementation.

Being a special type of the HY_Catchment, the catchment aggregate may be
part of a containing catchment at the next higher level of hierarchy,
which consists of similar-scale neighboring catchments. The catchment
aggregate does not necessarily imply a series of nested containing
catchments. It primarily allows navigation to the 'highest' level system
(total drainage basin) as typically used for reporting purposes.

[#figure30]
.Catchment aggregate (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig30.png[]

HY_CatchmentAggregate inherits through generalization the _outflow_,
_inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_,
_conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and
_catchmentRealization_ properties, and has _exorheicDrainage_ and
_endorheicDrainage_ _associations_.

 but may be temporarily connected to the enveloping catchment.

|=======================================================================

===== Dendritic Catchment

The HY_DendriticCatchment feature type (link:#figure31[Figure 31]) specializes the
general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is determined by a
single common downstream catchment. It represents the catchment as the
topological link between an inflow and an outflow. This allows
catchments to be connected in a dendritic network by upstream-downstream
relationships without knowing the complex hydrology between inflow and
outflow. This concept requires a stable identifier purposefully assigned
to the catchment and that catchments are delineated as a simple tree
hierarchy.

[#figure31]
.Dendritic catchment (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig31.png[]


HY_DendriticCatchment inherits from generalization the _code_,
_outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_,
_conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and
_catchmentRealization_ properties, and has an _encompassingCatchment
association_. The dendritic nature of this feature is enforced through
_single-outflow, single-receiving-catchment_ and
_single-lower-catchment_ constraints.

contributes to one and only one single outflow. A single outflow can be

unambiguously specify whether the outflow exists, or is nillable.
|Constraint

a|
_single-Receiving-Catchment_

 |defines a cardinality of '1' indicating that one and only one single
catchment receives flow via the outflow of the catchment. A receiving
catchment can be unknown (nillable) in a particular application, for

or an internal sink. An implementation SHOULD unambiguously specify
whether the receiving catchment exists, or is nillable. |Constraint

a|
_single-Lower-Catchment_

 |defines a cardinality of '1' indicating that one and only one lower
catchment exists neighboring the catchment. A lower catchment can be
unknown (nillable) in a particular application, for example in case of
the latest catchment contributing flow to the ocean or an internal sink.
An implementation SHOULD unambiguously specify whether the lower
catchment exists, or is nillable. |Constraint
|=======================================================================

===== Interior Catchment

The HY_InteriorCatchment feature type (link:#figure32[Figure 32]) specializes the
general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is generally not
connected to other catchments. This class describes the interior
catchment as a catchment enveloped by other catchments to which it may
temporarily contribute. While the interior catchment concept precludes
flow to neighboring surface catchments, holistically it is a candidate
for establishing connections to groundwater or atmospheric systems.

[#figure32]
.Interior catchment (UML class diagram)

HY_InteriorCatchment inherits from generalization the _code_, _outflow_,
_inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_,
_conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and
_catchmentRealization_ properties, and has an _envelopingCatchment_
_association_. A _nillable-outflow_ constraint emphasizes the
non-existing outflow.

|Constraint
|=======================================================================

===== Hydro Nexus

The HY_HydroNexus feature type (link:#figure33[Figure 33]) conceptualizes a
hydrologically determined nexus of a corresponding catchment (link:#figure26[Figure 26]). 
The hydro nexus represents the place where a catchment interacts
with another catchment, i.e. where the outflow of a contributing
catchment becomes inflow into a receiving catchment. A catchment may
receive flow from several upstream catchments or contribute flow to
several downstream catchments through a single hydro nexus. Through
shared identity, each hydro nexus feature may be associated with
different realizations within a hydrologic complex given that each
realization has the same hydrologic function or characteristics. This
includes the topological realization as a node on the one-dimensional
flowpath (edge) in terms of a topological 'boundary'.

Placed topologically relative to a catchment which links inflow and
outflow, a hydro nexus has a position relative to another hydro nexus
that is 'fixed' in the network by the catchments it is associated with.
Additionally, the union of catchment and hydro nexus(es) can be used to
define a linear river reference system, where an inflow or outflow node
is the origin and the flowpath realizing the catchment is the linear
element along which a position can be determined.

[#figure33]
.Hydro nexus (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig33.png[]

HY_HydroNexus carries the associations: _contributingCatchment_,
_receivingCatchment_, and _nexusRealization_.

identifies a hydrologic feature which realizes the hydro nexus. A
topological nexus realization is of lower dimension than the realization
of the corresponding catchment. Example: an outflow node realizing the
nexus would be of lower dimension than the flowpath edge realizing the
contributing catchment.

 |Association
|=======================================================================

===== Catchment Realization

The HY_CatchmentRealization feature type (link:#figure34[Figure 34]) is based on the
idea that there are multiple hydrology-specific perspectives of the
holistic catchment concept that are used to describe a catchment as a
unit of study shared across sub-domains and studies.

A given catchment realization exists within a hydrologic complex in
that, if a catchment realization exists, it exists in the same
hydrologic complex as the catchment it realizes. In this way, any
realization of a catchment has the same hydrologic determination of the
catchment it realizes. If a catchment is connected with other catchments
via inflow and/or outflow hydro nexuses, its realizations are also
connected. A realization of the logical catchment is always of higher
topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding hydro
nexus topological boundary. For example, a linear flowpath realizing a
catchment may be understood as an edge between inflow and outflow nodes;
the areal realization of a catchment as a face bounded by linear inflow
and outflow.

[#figure34]
.Catchment realization and its specialization (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig34.png[]

The catchment realization features defined in this standard refer to
objects on the land surface for the purpose of surface water hydrology.
In other contexts, other types of catchment realization may exist.
Catchment realizations that do not conform to those defined in this
standard, for instance realizations in 3- or 4-dimensional perspectives,
may be implemented using the general HY_CatchmentRealization type.
HY_CatchmentRealization carries a _shape_ attribute __ and as a
_realizedCatchment_ _association_.

_realizedCatchment_

identifies the one and only one catchment that is realized by a
particular feature. Referencing the hydrologic complex containing the
catchment and all of its realizations, supports a catchment's existence
to be recognized and linked to multiple realizations without the
complexity and full detail of a scientific model. By referencing the
catchment topology, topological relationships can be established and
common identifiers assigned.

 |Association
|=======================================================================

The *HY_Flowpath* feature type realizes a catchment specifically as a
path connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment it realizes.
HY_Flowpath specializes HY_CatchmentRealization with respect to an
implied linear geometric representation including a straight or curved
line. Topologically, the flowpath connects the inflow and outflow of the
catchment, and is understood as an edge bounded by an inflow node and an
outflow node, and corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment
faces. Hydrologically, the flowpath is a line describing a moving
particle of water. Through generalization, HY_Flowpath inherits the
_shape_ and the _realizedCatchment_ properties. The optional _shape_ of
the flowpath is usually a single curve.

The *HY_CatchmentDivide* feature type realizes a catchment specifically
as catchment boundary connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment
it realizes, whereby inflow and outflow may overlay. Implying a linear
geometric representation, a catchment boundary is topologically
understood as an edge bounded by inflow node and outflow nodes, and
corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment faces inside of the
boundary. Hydrologically, the boundary refers to the summit line
separating adjacent catchments. Through generalization,
HY_CatchmentDivide inherits the _shape_ and the _realizedCatchment_
properties. The _shape_ of the catchment divide may be implemented as a
composition of succeeding curves or a polygon ring.

The *HY_CatchmentArea* feature type realizes a catchment specifically as
a catchment area connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment it
realizes. HY_CatchmentArea specializes HY_CatchmentRealization with
respect to an implied areal geometric representation. Topologically, the
catchment area connecting the inflow and outflow of the catchment is a
face bounded inwards by an inflow edge and outwards by an outflow edge.
Hydrologically, catchment area refers to the area having a common outlet
for its runoff. Through generalization, HY_CatchmentArea inherits the
_shape_ and the _realizedCatchment_ properties. The optional _shape_
of the catchment may be implemented as a surface.

The *HY_HydroNetwork* feature type realizes a catchment as a network of
connected hydrologic features. Such a network realizes the hierarchical
network of logically connected catchments contained in a larger
catchment. It may be a sequence of flowpaths, an aggregate of catchment
areas or a mesh of catchment divides. HY_HydroNetwork feature type
specializes HY_CatchmentRealization. Through generalization it inherits
the _shape_ and the _realizedCatchment_ properties, and carries the
associations _flowpath_, _catchmentDivide_ and _catchmentArea_. The
optional _shape_ of the is usually given through the individual geometry
of the network parts.

The HY_CartographicRealization feature type realizes a catchment as set
of separate cartographic layers or maps, displaying a network of
hydrologic features which may be connected at the representation level,
or not. Specializing HY_CatchmentRealization, it inherits from
generalization the _shape_ attribute and the _realizedCatchment_
association.


===== Hydro Location

The HY_HydroLocation feature type (link:#figure35[Figure 35]) conceptualizes the idea
that a hydro nexus can be realized by practically any feature of
interest. The hydro nexus concept is used to define the hydrologic
determination of a catchment but, like the catchment concept, does not
have inherent realization(s). Any hydrologically significant feature
that can be identified as (said to be) the outlet of a catchment may
realize the hydro nexus. Typically, this will be a permanent, stable
location that is fixed and/or referenced by coordinates.

Landmarks such as confluences, points corresponding to vertical
sections, or the position of a monitoring station on a river are typical
realizations of the hydro nexus. Other kinds of hydro nexus realizations
that don't carry normal surface water characteristics as defined in this
standard, e.g. a spring where groundwater enters the surface, an
arbitrary point projected onto the surface, or a nexus that collects
many disjoint locations may use or specialize the general
HY_HydroLocation type.

Topologically, the HY_HydroLocation should be understood to be the
boundary of the corresponding catchment, and always of lower topological
dimension than the catchment. Even though the topological realization of
a hydro nexus is typically as a node between catchment edges, a nexus
realization may also have any geometric representation, including a
single point.

In many cases, HY_HydroLocations are known but corresponding catchments
and hydro nexuses are not defined. For example, stream gages that are
part of a catchment dataset whose hydro nexus features are realized by
confluences. Both the stream gages and confluences are
HY_HydroLocations, but the stream gages' hydro nexus features are not
defined. Using this concept, HY_HydroLocation is expected to be used to
link between datasets that have catchments delineated for different
HY_HydroLocations.

[#figure35]
.Hydro Nexus Realization - HydroLocation (UML class diagram)

==== TheÂ River Referencing model

The River Referencing model (link:#figure36[Figure 36]) provides a simple model to place
a feature of interest 'on a river'. It introduces the concept of
indirect position where a position is determined relative to an already
established reference location. This model defines a linear river
referencing system whose linear shape is given by a flowpath realizing
the catchment between its inflow and outflow. It is important to note,
that each catchment has its own reference system, which defines the
start (origin) and the orientation of the linear flowpath (axis) along
which the distance from a known referent can be measured. An
implementation SHOULD unambiguously specify whether the direction of the
measure (from referent) is with the catchment-specific orientation of
the flowpath, or opposite to this.

[#figure36]
.River Referencing (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig36.png[]


The River Referencing system uses the one-dimensional topological
realization of catchment within the implied hydrologic complex such that
the feature to be placed and the already located referent are nodes on
the boundary of the same flowpath. Given that a flowpath realizes a
catchment between inflow and outflow nodes, the feature of interest is
placed some distance along a flowpath, while the location being used as
a reference location is located at the upstream or downstream end of the
flowpath. Using located referents in both directions allows placement of
a feature of interest a percentage of the distance along a flowpath even
if the realized catchment is not explicitly delineated.


===== Indirect Position

The HY_IndirectPosition feature type defines the location referenced
along an axis, without the necessity of a geometric realization.
Indirect position uses a catchment-specific reference system which
defines the flowpath as the required linear element along which the
position is determined. The indirect position is then expressed as the
distance from the upstream and/or downstream end of the flowpath, or
from a referent that is already located on that flowpath.

The (indirect) position of an outflow node referenced along an upstream
oriented flowpath (link:#figure17[Figure 17]) can be expressed as the distance from an
upstream inflow node located on that flowpath, while the (indirect)
position of an inflow node referenced along a downstream oriented
flowpath (link:#figure18[Figure 18]) can be expressed as distance from a downstream
outflow node located on the flowpath. An 'intermediate' position
referencing known inflow and outflow nodes bounding a flowpath at both
ends (link:#figure19[Figure 19]) can be expressed as part of the distance along the
entire flowpath, measured from the upstream end of an upstream flowpath,
and/or from the downstream end of a downstream flowpath. A position
referencing an already referenced location on the flowpath can be
expressed as part of the distance along the entire flowpath, measured
from the 'located referent'.

HY_IndirectPosition carries the _distanceExpression_, and
_distanceDescription attributes_, and has _linearElement_,
_locatedReferent_ and a _referenceLocation_ associations. A
_point-referent_ constraint emphasizes the topological relationship
between the linear element and point representation of the reference
location; a _measure-along-flowpath_ constraint defines the flowpath as
the linear element to be used whenever a position is expressed as a
distance from a referent. Â

=== Surface Hydro Feature concepts

The Surface Hydro Feature application schema provides common concepts of
hydrologic features occurring on the land surface and specifies the core
concepts defined in the abstract Hydro Feature application schema. This
will enable contextually linked information models to build
relationships between multiple realizations of the same catchments.
Typical realizations of the catchment concept and hydro nexuses can be
described in a consistent way using standard terminology for the
relationships between surface water features defined in this application
schema.

[#figure37]
.Surface Hydro Feature - Application Schema Diagram
image::figures/fig37.png[]

The Surface Hydro Feature model (link:#figure37[Figure 37]) conceptualizes the
accumulation of water on the land surface in waterbodies (shown in
Blue), each made unique by its origin, size, or movement. With respect
to the management and storage of water resources, a concept of water
storage is provided and allows any waterbody type to be considered a
managed reservoir (shown in Purple).

Relying on a conceptual separation of waterbody and container, the
Surface Hydro Feature schema defines a network of potentially connected
depressions and channels on the land surface which periodically or
continuously contain water (shown in Orange). Separate from the
hydrographic network of permanent or temporary waterbodies, the channel
network can be used as the connecting system.

The definitions in this schema are rooted in the definitions given in
the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology which defines a network of
watercourse regardless of the location in respect to the Earth's
surface. The conceptual model defined here has been vetted in the
context of surface water hydrology. In other words, in this standard,
'channel network' and 'hydrographic network' refer to surface channels
or other containers for surface-waterbodies.

The Surface Hydro Feature application schema contains the leaf packages:
Channel Network, Hydrographic Network, Water Body Types and Storage.
link:#figure38[Figure 38] shows the external and internal dependencies.

[#figure38]
.Surface Hydro Feature - dependencies
image::figures/fig38.png[]



==== The Channel Network model

The Channel Network model defines a network of connected depressions and
channels which, in its entirety, can realize a catchment (link:#figure39[Figure 39]).
Usually this is a network of linear flowpaths realizing catchments
connected to each other within the containing catchment realized by the
entire network. This allows representation of the drainage pattern even
if logically connected features may or may not be connected in the
context of a particular representation.

[#figure39]
.Channel Network realizing the catchment (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig39.png[]

The channel network is defined independent of the hydrographic network.
This separates the concerns of hydraulics, focused on the analysis and
design of channels and conduits, from the concerns of hydrology, focused
on the occurrence and movement of water over land and in waterbodies. It
allows a catchment to be realized as a network of connected channels and
depressions, regardless of whether or not water is contained in them.

A single depression or channel may realize the catchment, either as part
of the network (link:#figure39[Figure 39]) or via a reference feature which realizes the
conceptual hydro nexus of the catchment (link:#figure40[Figure 40]). For example, a
point at an associated cross or longitudinal section may be considered
to realize the outflow of the catchment which is realized by the channel
expressed as a flowpath.

[#figure40]
.Depression and Channel realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig40.png[]

===== Channel Network

The HY_ChannelNetwork feature type specializes the HY_HydroNetwork
realization defined in the Hydro Feature core model, specifically as an
aggregate of surface depressions and surface channels which continuously
or periodically contain water, without imposing a particular drainage
pattern. This allows representation of the network, even if logically
connected features are not connected at the representation level. If the
realized catchment is connected with other catchments via hydro nexuses,
the channel network is considered connected to the channel network
realizing these catchments.

HY_ChannelNetwork has _surfaceDepression_ and _surfaceChannel_
_associations_, and carries a _drainagePattern_ attribute; it inherits
through generalization the _shape_ attribute, the _realizedCatchment_
association as well as _flowpath_, _catchmentDivide_ and _catchmentArea_
associations. Depending on the application, the channel network and the
related features may be described by suitable attributes. A
_channel-flowpath_ constraint is defined to support the recognition of
the channel as flowpath realizing the catchment.

|=======================================================================


===== Depression

The HY_Depression feature type specializes the general HY_HydroFeature
class. It describes land lower than the surrounding land as a container
for standing water. A depression is part of the network of channels and
depressions forming the connecting system in which waterbodies are
contained as parts of hydrographic network. Through generalization,
HY_Depression inherits the _name_ property. It has associations for the
_surfaceNetwork_ in which it participates, a body of _standingWater_ and
a stratum of a _confinedWaterBody_. An _outlet-at-benchmark_ constraint
emphasizes that a benchmark on the confined waterbody at the outlet of
the catchment that is realized by the channel network.

===== Channel

The HY_Channel feature type specializes the HY_Depression class with
respect to a natural or man-made, open or closed channel through or
along which water may or may not flow. A channel is part of the network
of channels and depressions which forms the connecting system for the
hydrographic network; a channel may have vertical sections at right
angles to the main (average) direction of flow or along its centerline.

HY_Channel has an association indicating the _channelNetwork_ in which
it participates. It carries the associations: _stream_,
_bedProfileTransversal_ and _bedProfileLongitudinal_. HY_Channel
inherits from generalization the _confinedWaterBody_ association and the
_outflow-at-benchmark_ constraint. An _outlet-at-profile_ constraint
emphasizes the recognition of vertical section as the outlet of the
catchment that is realized by the channel network.**

Â 

|=======================================================================


==== The Hydrographic Network model

The Hydrographic Network model defines a logical network of waterbodies
which, in its entirety, realizes a catchment (link:#figure41[Figure 41]). Most
typically, this is as a network of linear flowpaths realizing catchments
connected to each other within a containing catchment that is realized
by the entire network. This allows representation of the network of
'blue lines', even if logically connected features are not connected at
the representation level.

The hydrographic network is defined independent of the channel network.
This maintains a conceptual separation of concerns of hydrology studying
the occurrence, accumulation, and circulation of water and studies
related to containers of waterbodies. It allows realization of the
catchment as a network of moving or standing waterbodies, regardless of
the channels and depressions.

A single waterbody can realize its catchment either as part of the
hydrographic network (link:#figure41[Figure 41]), or via a reference location which
realizes the hydro nexus of the catchment realized by the waterbody
(link:#figure42[Figure 42]). For example, a fixed landmark, or a point at an associated
cross section is considered to realize the outflow of the catchment
which is realized by the waterbody.

[#figure41]
.Hydrographic Network realizing the catchment (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig41.png[]



===== Hydrographic Network

The HY_HydrographicNetwork feature type specializes the HY_HydroNetwork
realization defined in the Hydro Feature core model, specifically as an
aggregate of permanent or temporary bodies standing in depressions or
moving in channels. If the realized catchment is connected with other
catchments via hydro nexuses, the hydrographic network is considered
connected to the network realizing these catchments. This allows
representation of the network, even if logically connected features are
not connected at the representation level. If required, an application
focused on surface-waterbodies contained in channels or depressions may
use the defined relationships to describe the realization of a catchment
by the hydrographic network, or network parts associated with the
channel network.

HY_HydrographicNetwork has a _networkWaterBody_ _association_. Through
generalization, it inherits the _shape_ attribute and the
_realizedCatchment_ association as well as _flowpath,_ _catchmentDivide_
and _catchmentArea_ associations, and. A _waterbody-flowpath_ constraint
supports the recognition of the waterbody as a flowpath realizing the
catchment.

Â 

|=======================================================================


===== Water Body

The HY_WaterBody feature type specializes the general HY_HydroFeature
class. A waterbody is part of the hydrographic network and is either
standing in a depression or flowing in a channel, which are parts of the
channel network. A waterbody may be segmented in vertical sections at
right angles to the main (average) direction of flow or along its
centerline, and horizontal strata. Conceptually, each waterbody, or a
stratum, could be thought of as a reservoir used for storage, regulation
or control of water recourses.

[#figure42]
.Water Body realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig42.png[]

Through generalization, HY_WaterBody inherits the _name_ property. It
has associations for the _hydrographicNetwork_ in which it participates,
the containing _waterpool_ and _watercourse_, the vertical
_streamCrossSection_, _streamLongitudinalSection_, a horizontal
_stratum_, and a reservoir for _storage_ of water. _Outlet-at-section_
and _outlet-at-landmark_ constraints emphasize the recognition of a
fixed landmark as outlet of the catchment realized by hydrographic
network.

===== Water-Body Stratum

The HY_WaterBodyStratum feature type describes a horizontal layer in a
stratified waterbody determined by differences in thermal or salinity
characteristics or by oxygen or nutrient content, or by virtual storage
zones of a reservoir. HY_WaterBodyStratum carries the properties:
_stratumType_ and _benchmark_.

 a|
identifies a benchmark which realizes the conceptual hydro nexus of the
catchment realized by the waterbody.

 |Association
|=======================================================================


===== Cross-Section and Longitudinal Section

The HY_CrossSection and HY_LongitudinalSection feature types
conceptualize the segmentation of a waterbody or a containing channel
through vertical sections. Taking into account the conceptual separation
of a watercourse, the cross section concept refers to both the cross
section of a waterbody orthogonal to the direction of flow, and to the
transversal bed profile of a channel, The longitudinal section concept
refers to both the vertical section of a waterbody along its centerline,
and to the longitudinal bed profile of a channel.

Both types of vertical section associate _crossSectionPoint_ and
_longitudalinalSectionPoint_ which should be used to identify a
permanent reference location at a vertical section which realizes the
conceptual hydro nexus of the catchment realized by the associated
channel or waterbody.


===== Water-LiquidPhase and Water-SolidPhase

The HY_Water_LiquidPhase and HY_Water_SolidPhase feature types provide
simple concepts of the accumulation of water in waterbodies. This
definition refers to the matter accumulated to a mass of water. In its
liquid form water is considered accumulated in waterbodies; in its solid
phase water may be accumulated after melting, or as a layer of ice or
snow on an open waterbody. The accumulation of water in the atmosphere
or below the land surface, e.g. rain, soil moisture or groundwater, is
not in scope of this standard, as well as the accumulation of snow and
ice in glaciers which is subject of glaciology science.

Contextually related information models may use the HY_Water_LiquidPhase
and HY_Water_SolidPhase feature types to build relationships to an
accumulating waterbody, and ultimately to the catchment realized either
by the waterbody or by the network of which the waterbody is part.

HY_Water_LiquidPhase has an association with the
_accumulatingWaterBody_; HY_Water_SolidPhase has associations with the
water from _snowmelt_ and _coveredWaterBody_. These associations may be
used to identify the waterbody (as part of the hydrographic network)
where liquid water is accumulated.

Â 


==== The Surface-Water Body types

The Surface Water model defines typical specializations of a waterbody
on the land surface. Being a specialization of the HY_WaterBody class
each subtypes inherits the _stratum_, _waterpool_, _watercourse_,
_upstreamWaterBody_, _downstreamWaterBody__, fixedLandmark___,
_streamCrossSection_ and _streamLongitudinalSection_ properties. From
the general HY_HydroFeature class the special waterbodies inherit the
_name_ property, which allows to handle names given to them in
cross-jurisdiction and multi-lingual contexts. Each specialization is
understood to be part of the hydrographic network. In other contexts
other specializations, or a typical segmentation may exist, that not
conforms to the types defined in this standard.

The HY_River feature type defines the existence of body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, special due to its
property to permanently or temporarily flow.

The HY_Canal feature type defines the existence of body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, special due to its
artificial origin (man-made).

The HY_Lake feature type defines the existence of body of surface water,
participating in a hydrographic network, special due to its considerable
size.

The HY_Impoundment feature type defines the existence of body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, special due to be formed
by collecting water, as by a dam.

The HY_Lagoon feature type defines the existence of body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, special due to its
shallow depth and interaction with the open sea.

The HY_Estuary feature type defines the existence of body of surface
water, participating in a hydrographic network, special due to branching
and its interaction with the open sea.


==== The Storage model

The Storage model (link:#figure43[Figure 43]) provides a concept to describe any
waterbody, in terms of a reservoir storing water for future use. The
separation of the storage model allows description of the hydrographic
network without the details of storage capacities that a waterbody may
have, and vice versa, storage reservoirs can be described independent of
their role within the hydrographic network.

[#figure43]
.Reservoir realizing the hydro nexus (UML class diagram)
image::figures/fig43.png[]

The HY_Reservoir feature type describes the waterbody, either natural or
man-made, used for storage, regulation and control of water resources.
The reservoir concept refers to a volume of water managed in zones
between operating levels. HY_Reservoir has associations bettwen a
reservoir and the _storedWaterBody_ and a _reservoirZone_.

=== Hydrometric Network concepts

The Hydrometric Network application schema (link:#figure44[Figure 44] 
and link:#figure45[Figure 45]) define a logical
model to take into account a network of hydrometric stations as a
specific realization of the catchment in the perspective of hydrologic
observation, without the detail of an observation strategy.

The Hydrometric Network model specifies the concepts defined in the
Hydro Feature core model. The general concept is that of a network of
logically connected hydrometric stations realizing as a whole the
catchment. This enables contextually related information models to
relate monitoring stations and observing posts to hydrologic features,
as is often required for environmental reporting or when interpreting,
analyzing and processing observation results.

[#figure44]
.Hydrometric Network - dependencies
image::figures/fig44.png[]

The hydrometric network model introduces the concept of a 'position on
river' which allows a hydrologic station, which may not have a precisely
known location, to be the located on a river. This supports the
establishment of upstream-downstream relationships between hydrometric
features, assignment of a position relative to a 'fixed' hydro nexus, or
to place other features of interest relative to the hydrometric station.

_hydrometricNetwork_ in which it participates, and a _positionOnRiver_.
An _outlet-at-station_ constraint emphasizes the recognition of a
