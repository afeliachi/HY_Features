=== The HY_Features conceptual model

This standard defines the HY_Features conceptual model as a standard for the identification and description of hydrologic features reflecting both hydrologic significance and topological connectivity of hydrologic features. HY_Features formalizes the fundamental relationships between components of the hydrosphere. It describes the hydrosphere as a hierarchical network of hydrologically connected catchments, their organization in networks of catchments and/or waterbodies, and their various visual and topological realizations.

Core concepts of HY_Features are: 1) an abstract idea of 'catchment' witch has many possible 'realizations', 2) upstream - downstream catchment topology and nested hierarchy, 3) aggregation of networks of watercourses within catchment networks, and 4) linear referencing along a river using a nominal main flow path. The single concept that governs HY_Features is that any place on the land surface can be thought of as the outfall of a corresponding catchment and be placed into a hydrologic topology of connected, often named, hydrologic features.

The conceptual model is implemented in several discrete modules. It is intended that implementations of the conceptual model need to consider only those parts of the model required. An implementation may include or exclude feature properties, or allow cardinality of one or more associations to be ‘nillable’. Table 1 lists the application schemas, the leaf packages included and the concepts reflected therein.

The conceptual model is expressed in the Geographic Information Conceptual Schema Language (ISO 19103:2005) based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The organization into packages and package dependencies are shown in link:#figure16[Figure 16]. The following sections describe requirements classes for each application schema, whereby each feature addressed in the requirements shall be understood as an instance of the GF_FeatureType (aka FeatureType) «metaclass». For the purpose of consistency with the conceptual UML model the British spelling of feature type names and properties has been adopted.

=== The HY_Features conceptual conformance (mapping)

The HY_Features model is a 'conceptual model', not intended to be directly implementable for data exchange or persistence. The conformance target of the HY_Features model is therefore a logical model of an implementation that encodes aspects of the HY_Features model. 

Conformance to the HY_Features model is a matter of being able to unambiguously identify what elements of an implementation schema map to the HY_Features model, and inclusion of all mandatory properties of the defined Feature Types in such mappings. 

The HY_Features conceptual model provides the basis for determining whether two references to hydrologic features are references to the same feature. i.e. to specify the real world type of features independent of their implementation or format. More specifically, it provides the means to distinguish between the reference concept (e.g. a catchment) and its realizations as geographic features (e.g. flowpath, catchment area or boundary), and hence to declare that different realizations share common hydrological connectivity. 

Disparate systems describing hydrologic features may be mapped to the equivalent HY_Features definitions to disambiguate the local usage of terminology and specific implementation choices made. 

Note that a direct encoding of HY_Features to an implementation format such as RDF may be implemented through annotation or direct correspondence of names to the HY_Feature elements.

include::requirements/req01.adoc[]

An implementation schema conforming to HY_Features SHALL provide a formal mapping from one or more Feature Types present in the implementation schema to Feature Types defined in this standard specification, including all mandatory properties defined by the realized HY_Features concept. Default values to be assumed must be specified in this mapping.

=== The HY_Features data conformance (encoding)

As a conceptual model HY_Features does not specify conformance requirements regarding the structure of possible encodings. It does however specify that equivalence of feature instances can be expressed. The requirement that arises is therefore that the content of feature identification elements can be matched among implementations. This does not demand the use of identical identifiers across different implementations, but it does require that implementations provide a mechanism to match identifiers from different schemes.

include::requirements/req02.adoc[]

Implementations of HY_Features SHALL either use common identifiers for instances of Feature Types mapped to the same underlying HY_Features Feature Type, OR provide a mechanism to match identifiers from different identification schemes.

=== The Hydro Feature application schema

The Hydro Feature schema provides the core concepts of a named hydrologic feature, of a catchment and its multiple realizations, and of a river positioning using a linear referencing. Hydrologic features are identified by hydrologically significant characteristics and feature topology according to hydrologic rules. Providing a standard terminology for the typical relationships between hydrologic features allows the hydrosphere to be expressed in a consistent way across multiple data products, regardless of various spatial or temporal representations. 

Hydrologic features are usually named in cross-jurisdictional and multi-lingual contexts. The Hydro Feature schema provides a concept for a named hydrologic feature which allows the use of multiple names and identifiers without the need for a formal naming model. The named hydrologic feature is further described using various domain-specific feature types, which specify properties of the specializations to define one or more aspects of the hydrology phenomenon (link:#figure17[Figure 17]).

The Hydro Feature schema provides the core model of catchments and their multiple realizations. The catchment model denotes the hydrologic definition of a catchment by its outlet, conceptualized as HY_Outfall, and the interaction of catchments through such defined outfalls. This allows division of the hydrosphere into a logically connected network of catchments. Depending on the perspective of a particular study, the logical catchment can be realized in multiple ways by geometric or topologic features. The Hydro Feature schema provides a model to place a catchment's outfall relative to a feature which realizes the logical outfall. The river positioning model provides a river reference system which allows linear referencing of an outfall (typically a monitoring location) using the linear realization of a catchment that corresponds to another outfall (typically a confluence).

[#figure17]
.Hydrologic features describing separate aspects of the hydrology phenomenon
image::figures/fig17.png[]

The definitions applied in the Hydro Feature schema are rooted in the definitions given in the WMO Glossary of Hydrology regardless of their application context in respect to the Earth's surface. For the purpose of testing the applicability of the conceptual model in the context of surface water hydrology, the definitions in this standard refer to surface water hydrology. A conceptual model capturing the specifics of features associated with the groundwater domain is developed with reference to the OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundwaterML2 standard [6].

The Hydro Feature schema contains the leaf packages: NamedFeature, HydroComplex, and RiverPositioningSystem. link:#figure18[Figure 18] shows the external dependencies.

include::requirements/req03.adoc[]

==== The Named Feature model

The Named Feature model (link:#figure19[Figure 19]) denotes the abstraction of the hydrology phenomenon as a named hydrologic feature. It provides an approach to identify a named hydrologic feature in cross-jurisdiction and multi-lingual contexts by considering the cultural, political and historical aspects of names assigned to hydrologic features in common usage. 

[#figure19]
.Named Feature (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/namedFeature/hydrofeature[/req/hy_hydrofeature/namedFeature/hydrofeature])
image::figures/fig19.png[]

The HY_HydroFeature feature type is further specialized by separate feature types. Each specialization inherits the properties from generalization; HY_HydroFeature type has one association: _name_.

The *name* associates a name given to the hydrologic feature in cultural, political or historical context. If required, this association shall be used where names are assigned to a feature instance in cross-jurisdictional and multi-lingual contexts, that may occur with trans-boundary features. 

include::requirements/req04.adoc[]

The HY_HydroFeatureName feature type provides an abstract pattern to handle cultural, political and historical variability of names. This the assignment of a referencable name for all or part of a hydrologic feature without necessarily have a formal model for naming. HY_HydroFeatureName has five attributes: _name_, _namesPart_, _preferredBy_, _usage_ and _variantSpelling_. If required, an implementation shall use this type to describe the usage of multiple names. The usage type may be identified using the HY_NameUsage code list described in link:#anex6_4[Annex B.4].

include::requirements/req05.adoc[]

==== The Hydro Complex model

The Hydro Complex model conceptualizes the hydrologic definition of a catchment through an 'outfall' feature with the role of getting flow from a contributing catchment, or providing inflow to a receiving catchment (link:#figure20[Figure 20] and link:#figure21[Figure 21]). Conceptually, each catchment has an outfall, and any outfall has a corresponding catchment, even if catchment and/or outfall may not be present in a particular application. A catchment interacts with upper and lower catchments via associated outfalls, and ultimately contributes flow to the outfall of a containing catchment. The catchment should be understood as the logical link between two outfalls.

The Hydro Complex model implies a collection of hydrologic features that form a hydrologically closed system. The union of a catchment, its inflow and outflow (conceptualized as outfalls) is realized by typical hydrologic features to form a single hydrologic complex. A topological realization of the logical catchment is always of higher topological dimension than the realization of the corresponding outfall in terms of a topological boundary. For example, a linear flowpath realizing a catchment may be understood as an edge between inflow and outflow nodes; the areal realization of a catchment as a face bounded by linear inflow and outflow.

The Hydro Complex model allows the realization of a logical outfall to be any arbitrary location with various realizations of its own. Such a 'real' outfall provides an identifiable reference feature to which alternative catchment realizations may refer. This very general outfall feature supports establishment of topological relationships between hydrographic features, or between hydrographic and hydrometric features. The Hydro Complex model also allows for catchments to be recognized through reference to an outfall even if stream networks, catchment areas or watersheds are not available. It is intended that hydrological reporting applications may use this model without the full complexity and detail of scientific catchment models.

===== Catchment

The HY_Catchment feature type represents a hydrologically determined feature through association an outfall, and the logical network of catchments that form a connected network of smaller catchments and outfalls within the catchment. Each HY_Catchment may provide association between its many realizations within a hydrologically determined hydrologic complex. These realizations include both geometric and topological realizations such as an edge 'bounded' by inflow and outflow nodes. HY_Catchment is an abstract class and may be further specialized with respect to catchment interaction.

[#figure20]
.Catchment (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment])
image::figures/fig20.png[]

The HY_Catchment type (link:#figure20[Figure 20]) specializes the general HY_HydroFeature class. Through generalization, HY_Catchment inherits the name property, and carries the code attribute and the associations: _outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_, _conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, _realisation_.

The *code* attribute may be used to assign a unique identifier to the catchment in given context. If required, the code attribute shall be implemented using a controlled classification or coding system. Example: WMO Basin Codes. 

The *outflow* and *inflow* associations describe the outfall in terms of outflow or inflow to or from the corresponding catchment. Assuming a dendritic network of catchments, the outflow of a contributing catchment coincides with the inflow to a receiving catchment. This allows description of upstream-downstream relations. If required, this association shall be used to identify the place to which flow is contributed, or where flow is received from.

[#figure21]
.Catchment and outfall (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.inflow[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.inflow] , https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.outflow[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.outflow])
image::figures/fig21.png[]

The *containingCatchment* and *containedCatchment* associations connect the nesting of catchments in a simple “is-in” containment hierarchy as typically used for high-order organization of management and reporting units. If required, this association shall be used to identify a nesting catchment or the catchments nested therein.

[#figure22]
.Containing / contained catchment (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.containingcatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.containingcatchment] , https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.containedcatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.containedcatchment])
image::figures/fig22.png[]

The *conjointCatchment* association describes the interaction of a catchment with another catchment crossing an internal boundary line. This line may be a divide separating adjacent catchments, or a diffuse divide between non-delineated sub-catchments within an encompassing catchment, or a fictive line between distant catchments. If required, this association shall be used to identify a catchment contributing with others to a 'joined' outfall. Assuming a dendritic network of catchments, where each catchment is determined by its single outflow, this association may be used to summarize diffuse inflow into an encompassing catchment, as required to describe inflow to headwater catchments.

[#figure23]

image::figures/fig23.png[]

The *upperCatchment* and *lowerCatchment* associations connect the catchment to the adjacent catchment above or below. This allows the description of connected catchments without knowing their inflow or outflow outfalls. If required, this association shall be used to trace the catchment network in upstream direction from mouth to source, or downstream from source to mouth.

[#figure24]
.Upper / lower catchment (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.uppercatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.uppercatchment], https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.lowercatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchment.lowercatchment])
image::figures/fig24.png[]

The *realisation* association relates the catchment to a feature which realizes the logical catchment. This supports linking multiple realizations of the same catchment. If required, this association shall be used identify a particular realization. In case of a topological realization, the realization of the catchment shall be of higher dimension than the realization of the outfall.

include::requirements/req06.adoc[]

===== Catchment Aggregate

The HY_CatchmentAggregate feature type (link:#figure25[Figure 25]) specializes the HY_Catchment as a set of non-overlapping dendritic and interior catchments arranged in an encompassing catchment. This allows description of multiple inflows into a catchment aggregate through several hydrologically discrete sub-catchments each with a single inflow, and contributing to a joined outflow of the catchment aggregate, including the 'nillable' outflow of interior catchments. Nillable is meant to signify that the outfall exists, in the form of flow to the subsurface or atmosphere but is unknown in a given implementation. The catchment aggregate may be part of a containing catchment at the next higher level of hierarchy, which consists of similar-scale neighboring catchments. The catchment aggregate does not necessarily imply a series of nested containing catchments. It primarily allows navigation to the 'highest' level system (total drainage basin) as typically used for reporting purposes.

[#figure25]
.Catchment aggregate (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchmentaggregate[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchmentaggregate])
image::figures/fig25.png[]
HY_CatchmentAggregate inherits from generalization the _outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_, _conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and _realisation_ properties, and associates the _exorheicDrainage_ and _endorheicDrainage_. 

The *exorheicDrainage* association references an exorheic drained catchment connected to others in a dendritic network. The *endorheicDrainage* association references an endorheic drained catchment, temporarily connected to the enveloping aggregate. If required, these associations shall be used to identify aggregated catchment parts which permanently or temporarily interact with other catchment parts at the same hierarchy level. 

include::requirements/req07.adoc[] 

===== Dendritic Catchment

The HY_DendriticCatchment feature type (link:#figure26[Figure 26]) specializes the general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is determined by a single common downstream catchment. It represents the catchment as the topological link between an inflow and an outflow. This allows catchments to be connected in a dendritic network by upstream-downstream relationships without knowing the complex hydrology between inflow and outflow. This concept requires a stable identifier purposefully assigned to the catchment and that catchments are delineated as a simple tree hierarchy. The dendritic nature of this class is enforced through constraints that the catchment must have one and only one outflow (which can be unknown), must have one and only one lowerCatchment (which may be unknown), and must have an outflow that contributes to only one receiving catchment. 

[#figure26]
.Dendritic catchment (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/dendriticcatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/dendriticcatchment])
image::figures/fig26.png[]

HY_DendriticCatchment inherits from generalization the code, _outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_, _conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and _realisation_ properties, and associates the encompassingCatchment.


The *encompassingCatchment* association relates to the dendritic catchment the aggregate encompassing the catchment. If required, this association shall be used to identify the catchment encompassing one or more exorheic or endorheic drained catchments contributing flow to the common outlet, either from a single identified inflow, or in joining with other sub-catchments crossing a divide internal to the encompassing aggregate catchment.

include::requirements/req08.adoc[] 

===== Interior Catchment

The HY_InteriorCatchment feature type (link:#figure27[Figure 27]) specializes the general HY_Catchment class as a catchment which is generally not connected to other catchments. This class describes the interior catchment as a catchment enveloped by other catchments to which it may temporarily contribute. While the interior catchment concept precludes flow to neighboring surface catchments, holistically it is a candidate for establishing connections to groundwater or atmospheric systems.

[#figure27]
.Interior catchment (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/interiorcatchment[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/interiorcatchment])
image::figures/fig27.png[]

HY_InteriorCatchment inherits from generalization the code, _outflow_, _inflow_, _containingCatchment_, _containedCatchment_, _conjointCatchment_, _upperCatchment_, _lowerCatchment_, and _realisation_ properties, and associates the envelopingCatchment.

The *envelopingCatchment* association relates to the interior catchment the aggregate surrounding the catchment. If required, this association shall be used to identify the catchment enveloping one or more endorheic drained catchments contributing 'nillable' flow to the common outlet. 

include::requirements/req09.adoc[] 

===== Outfall

The HY_Outfall feature type (link:#figure28[Figure 28]) conceptualizes the hydrologically determined outfall of a corresponding catchment (link:#figure21[Figure 21]). The logical outfall represents the logical place where a catchment interacts with another catchment, i.e. where the outflow of a contributing catchment becomes inflow into a receiving catchment. A catchment may receive flow from several catchments or contribute flow to several catchments through a single logical outfall. Logically placed in reference to a catchment which links inflow and outflow, an outfall has a position relative to another outfall that is 'fixed' by the catchment. Through unique identity, each outfall feature may associate different outfall realizations within an hydrologic complex given that each realization has the same hydrologic determination. This includes the topological realization as a node in terms of the 'boundary' on a catchment edge. 

[#figure28]
.Outfall (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/outfall[req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/outfall])
image::figures/fig28.png[]

HY_Outfall carries the associations: _contributingCatchment_, _receivingCatchment_, _relativePosition_ and _outfallRealisation_. 

The *contributingCatchment* association relates the outfall to the catchment that contributes flow to it. This allows relation of a catchment's outflow to an identified inflow and to determine its position through referencing an outfall. If required, this association shall be used to identify the catchment connecting the outfall and an inflow used for reference. 

The *receivingCatchment* association relates to the outfall to a catchment that receives flow from it. This allows relation of a catchment's inflow to an identified outflow and to determine its position through referencing an outfall. If required, this association shall be used to identify the catchment connecting the outfall and the outflow used for reference.

The *relativePosition* association assigns a position to the outfall relative to a reference location (typically an outfall realization) fixed in the logical network of catchments. This means that the position of an outfall is determined relative to another realized outfall. If required, this association shall be used to assign a position to an inflow or outflow of a catchment using existing reference location(s). Commonly, this is used to locate an outfall such as at a hydrometric station, to a reference outfall such as a confluence but it can be used to locate any outfall relative to another.


The *outfallRealisation* association relates the outfall to a feature which realizes the logical outfall. If required, this association shall be used to describe the 'real' object considered to be outfall of a catchment. In case of a topological realization, the realization of the outfall shall be of lower dimension than the realization of the corresponding catchment.

include::requirements/req10.adoc[] 

===== Catchment Realization

The HY_CatchmentRealisation feature type (link:#figure29[Figure 29]) conceptualizes the multiple realization of an 'un-realized', logical catchment, by typical features used to describe a catchment as a unit of study shared across sub-domains and studies. HY_CatchmentArea, HY_CatchmentBoundary, HY_Flowpath and HY_WaterEdge are special types of catchment realization defined to topologically realize the hydrologically determined logical catchment in terms of face, edge, and node, as well as to reflect the connectivity of catchments by hydrologic features connected in networks. Topologically, the catchment area is a face bounded by catchment boundary and flowpath. Flowpath and water edge are topological edges each bounded by an inflow node and an outflow node. The HY_HydroNetwork type realizes a logical catchment as a collection of connected network features, the HY_CartographicRealisation as a set of map layers.


The catchment realization concept implies a hydrologic complex in that, if a catchment realization exists, they are in the same hydrologic complex as the catchment they realize. In this way, any feature realization of a logical catchment has the same hydrologic determination as the realized catchment. If the realized catchment is connected with other catchments via its outfall, possible feature realizations are also connected.

[#figure29]
.Catchment realization and its specialization (UML class diagram, https://github.com/opengeospatial/HY_Features/blob/master/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchmentrealisation[/req/hy_hydrofeature/hydrocomplex/catchmentrealisation])
image::figures/fig29.png[]

The catchment realization feature types defined in this standard refer to objects on the land surface for the purpose of surface water hydrology. In other contexts, other types of catchment realization may exist. Catchment realizations that do not conform to those defined in this standard, for instance realizations in 3 or 4 dimensional perspectives, may use the general HY_CatchmentRealisation type. 

HY_CatchmentRealisation carries the _realisedCatchment_ association implying the _hydroComplex_. ‘Tagged values’ are used to describe the *hydroComplex* which encompasses a realization feature in the same hydrologic complex as the realized catchment.

The *realisedCatchment* association relates a particular realization with the catchment it realizes. Referencing the hydrologic complex encompassing the catchment and its realizations, allows a catchment's existence to be recognized and linked to multiple realizations without the complexity and full detail of a scientific model. By referencing the fundamental hydrologically determined catchment, topological relationships can be established and common identifiers assigned. If required, this association shall be used to identify the unit of study realized in a domain-specific feature.

include::requirements/req11.adoc[] 

The HY_Flowpath feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation with respect to an implied linear geometric representation including a straight or curved line. Hydrologically, the flowpath is a line describing a moving particle of water. Topologically, the flowpath connects the inflow and outflow of the logical catchment, and is understood as an edge bounded by an inflow node and an outflow node, and corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment faces. The 'boundary' and 'spoke' properties are described by means of 'tagged values': the topological 'boundary' is of type HY_OutfallRealisation, the topological 'spoke' of type HY_CatchmentArea.

Through generalization, HY_Flowpath inherits the _realisedCatchment_ association including _hydroComplex_, and carries the properties: shape, and _flowpathNetwork_.

The *shape* attribute defines the linear geometric representation. If required, an implementation shall use a geometry type defined in ISO 19107: Spatial Schema, e.g. GM_Curve type.

The *flowpathNetwork* association defines a network as sequence of connected flowpaths. This concept requires a non-branching 'mainstem' of watercourses, and a single linear representation of each of these. If required, this association may be used to identify the network which realizes as a whole the catchment that contains the catchment realized by the single part. 

include::requirements/req12.adoc[] 

The HY_WaterEdge feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation with respect to an implied linear geometric representation including a closed line. Hydrologically, the water edge follows the line of intersection between a water body stratum and the confining depression, or channel. Topologically, the water edge realizes the catchment as an edge connecting inflow and outflow realized as nodes fixed at the inflow node and outflow node of the corresponding flowpath. The 'boundary' of type HY_OutfallRealisation is described by means of 'tagged values'.

Through generalization, HY_WaterEdge inherits the _realisedCatchment_ association including _hydroComplex_, and carries the properties: _shape_, _waterEdgeNetwork_. 

The *shape* attribute defines the linear geometric representation. If required, an implementation shall use a geometry type defined in ISO 19107: Spatial Schema, e.g. GM_Curve type.

The *waterEdgeNetwork* association defines an aggregate of water edges forming a connected network. This concept requires an aggregate of non-overlaying edges, and a single linear representation of each of these. If required, this association may be used to identify the network which realizes as a whole the catchment that contains the catchment realized by the single part. 

include::requirements/req13.adoc[] 

The HY_CatchmentBoundary feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation with respect to an implied linear geometric representation including a single polygon. The catchment boundary connecting the inflow and outflow of the logical catchment, whereby inflow and outflow may overlay. It is topologically understood as an edge bounded by inflow node and outflow nodes, and corresponding to left-bank and right-bank catchment faces inside of the boundary. The 'boundary' and 'spoke' properties are described by means of 'tagged values': the topological 'boundary' is of type HY_OutfallRealisation; the topological 'spoke' is of type HY_CatchmentArea.HY_CatchmentBoundary inherits from generalization the _realisedCatchment_ association incl. _hydroComplex_, and carries the properties: shape, and _boundaryNetwork_.

The *shape* attribute defines the linear geometric representation. If required, an implementation shall use a geometry type defined in ISO 19107: Spatial Schema, e.g. GM_CompositeCurve type. 

The *boundaryNetwork* association defines a network as mesh of connected boundaries. This concept requires a mesh of non-overlapping boundary lines, and a single linear representations of each of these. If required, this association may be used to identify the network which realizes as a whole the catchment that contains the catchment realized by the single part. 

include::requirements/req14.adoc[] 

The HY_CatchmentArea feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation with respect to an implied areal geometric representation including a plane surface. The catchment area connecting the inflow and outflow of the logical catchment, is topologically a face bounded inwards by an inflow edge and outwards by an outflow edge. The 'boundary' is described by means of 'tagged values': the inward directed 'boundary' is of type HY_CatchmentBoundary, the outward directed 'boundary' of type HY_Flowpath. A topological 'spoke' is not defined in this standard.

HY_CatchmentArea inherits from generalization the _realisedCatchment_ association incl. _hydroComplex_, and carries the properties: _shape_, and _areaNetwork_.

The *shape* attribute defines the linear geometric representation. If required, an implementation shall use a geometry type defined in ISO 19107: Spatial Schema, e.g. GM_Surface type.

The *areaNetwork* association defines an aggregate of catchment areas forming a connected network. This concept requires a non-overlapping aggregate of areas, and a single areal representation of each of these. If required, this association may be used to identify the network which realizes as a whole the catchment that contains the catchment realized by the single part. 

include::requirements/req15.adoc[] 

The HY_HydroNetwork feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation with respect to a network of connected hydrologic features. Such a network realizes in the hierarchical network of logically connected catchments contained in a higher-order catchment. It may be a sequence of flowpaths, an aggregate of water edges, an aggregate of catchment areas or a mesh of catchment boundaries. HY_HydroNetwork inherits the _realisedCatchment_ association including _hydroComplex_, and carries the associations _flowpath_, _waterEdge_, _catchmentBoundary_ and _catchmentArea_.

The HY_CartographicRealisation feature type specializes HY_CatchmentRealisation separate cartographic layers or maps, displaying a network of hydrologic features which may be connected at the representation level, or not. HY_HydroNetwork inherits from generalization the _realisedCatchment_ association including _hydroComplex_.
