[#annexB_1]
=== Terms identifying a fixed landmark determined to realize the conceptual outfall

[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%”, options=“header”]
|===
|Code list|*Realized Outfall Type*
|barrage |barrier across a stream provided with a series of gates or other control mechanisms to control the water-surface level upstream, to regulate the flow or to divert water supplies into a canal.
|bifurcation |division of a stream into two branches
|confluence |joining, or the place of junction, of two or more streams.
|dam |barrier constructed across a valley for impounding water or creating a reservoir.
|diversion of water|transfer of water from one watercourse to another, such watercourses being either natural or man-made.
|fork|(1) place where two or more streams flow together to form a larger stream. (2) place where a stream divides into two or more streams.
|hydrometric station|station at which data on water in rivers, lakes or reservoirs are obtained on one or more of the following elements: stage, streamflow, sediment transport and deposition, water temperature and other physical properties of water, characteristics of ice cover and chemical properties of water.
|inlet|structure admitting water supplies from the source or through an intake structure built upstream.
|intake|structure or site, the purpose of which is to control, regulate, divert, and admit water directly from the source, through an inlet built upstream.
|outlet|opening through which water flows out or is extracted from a reservoir or stream.
|ponor|hole or opening in the bottom or side of a depression where a surface stream or lake flows either partially or completely underground into a karst groundwater system. 
|rapids|reach of a stream where the flow is very swift and shooting, and where the surface is usually broken by obstructions, but has no actual waterfall or cascade. 
|reference climatological station|rclimatological station the data of which are intended for the purpose of determining climatic trends. This requires long periods (not less than thirty years) of homogeneous records, where man-made environmental changes have been and/or are expected to remain at a minimum. Ideally the records should be of sufficient length to enable the identification of secular changes of climate. 
|river mouth|rplace of discharge of a river into a sea or a lake.
|sinkhole|place where water disappears underground in a limestone region. It generally implies water loss in a closed depression or blind valley. 
|source|origin of the river
|spring|place where water flows naturally from a rock or soil onto land or into a body of surface water.
|waterfall|vertical fall or the very steep descent of a stream of water. 
|weir|overflow structure which may be used for controlling upstream water level or for measuring discharge or for both.

[#annexB_2]
=== Terms commonly used in hydrology to describe a spatial relation between two points

[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%”, options=“header”]
|===
|Code list|*Realized Outfall Type*
|at |located at the (reference) point
|between |located between two (reference) points
|downstream |located downstream of the (reference) point, e.g. in the direction of the current in a river or stream.
|left |located left-hand of the (reference) point when facing downstream.
|nearby |located in a short distance to the (reference) point.
|right |located right-hand of the (reference) point when facing downstream.
|upstream |located upstream of the (reference) point, e.g. in the direction towards the source of a stream.

[#annexB_3]
=== Terms commonly used in hydrology to describe a drainage pattern

[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%”, options=“header”]
|===
|Code list|*Realized Outfall Type*
|annular |main rivers have circular pattern with subsidiary channels at right angles.
|centripetal |streams flow inward to center.
|dendritic |spreading treelike arrangement; no evident orientation of channels (random orientation).
|distributary| one main channel divides into many channel-ways ending with many outlets.
|parallel |main channels regularly spaced and parallel or sub-parallel to each other; tributaries join at very acute angles.
|pinnate |featherlike, closely grouped , short tributaries (fine texture).
|radial |streams flow outward from center.
|rectangular |drainage forms a perpendicular net with the two directions equally developed.
|trellis |a dominant drainage direction with a secondary direction perpendicular to this; primary tributaries join main stream at right angles, secondary tributaries parallel main stem.

[#annexB_4]
=== Terms commonly used in hydrology to describe a drainage pattern

[cols=">20h,<80d",width="100%”, options=“header”]
|===
|Code list|*Realized Outfall Type*
|conventional |accepted, used, or practiced by most people ('agreed by convention’).
|historical |restricted to or based on fact in history
|official |ordered or allowed by those in authority
|vernacular| used in or suitable for speech, usually not used in formal writing
