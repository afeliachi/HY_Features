[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) implementation standard defines a standard information model for the identification of surface hydrologic features independent of geometric representation and scale. The conceptual model describes hydrologic features by defining the fundamental relationships among major components of the hydrosphere. This includes relationships such as the hierarchy of catchments, the segmentation of watercourses, and the topological connectivity of hydrologic features such as watersheds and water bodies. 
The standard is based on the concept that a given hydrologic feature may have multiple representations. This supports referencing the same feature(s) in different information systems or products and assists the organization and cataloging of observations, model results, or other studies of a feature. The ability to represent the same watershed, river, or other hydrologic feature in several ways is critical to aggregation of cross-referenced features into integrated datasets and data products on global, regional, or basin scales.Hydrologic feature types are defined using the OGC General Feature Model (ISO 19109:2006) with reference to definitions from the International Glossary for Hydrology. The conceptual model is expressed in the Geographic Information Conceptual Schema Language (ISO 19103:2005) using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This standard defines the HY_Features common hydrologic feature model for the identification of hydrologic features. It is intended to be used to document and share information about the objects of study and reporting in Hydrology in many applications. This standard was originally commissioned to link hydrologic information across the scientific and technical programs of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and to assist the WMO Members to discover, access and use hydrologic data from different sources.
This standard has been designed to support the need for governance and guidance by national and international authorities. Aspects of the standard that support this end are; 1) its canonical form, 2) its implementation neutrality, 3) conformity to internationally recognized standards of geographic information, and its use of semantics inferred from terminology endorsed by the WMO and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
