[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) standard defines a common conceptual information model for identification of specific hydrologic features independent of their geometric representation and scale. The model describes types of surface hydrologic features by defining fundamental relationships among various components of the hydrosphere. This includes relationships such as hierarchies of catchments, segmentation of rivers and lakes, and the hydrologically determined topological connectivity of features such as catchments and waterbodies. The standard also defines normative requirements for HY_Features implementation schemas and mappings to meet in order to be conformant with the conceptual model.

The HY_Features model is based on an abstract catchment feature type that can have multiple alternate hydrology-specific realizations and geometric representations. It supports referencing information about a hydrologic feature across disparate information systems or products to help improve data integration within and among organizations. The model can be applied to cataloging of observations, model results, or other study information involving hydrologic features. The ability to represent the same catchment, river, or other hydrologic feature in several ways is critical for aggregation of cross-referenced or related features into integrated data sets and data products on global, regional, or basin scales.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This standard defines the HY_Features common hydrologic feature model for use in identification of features as specific kinds of hydrologic features. It is intended to be used to document and share information about features that are the subject of hydrologic studies and reporting for a range of applications. HY_Features was originally commissioned to link hydrologic information across the scientific and technical programs of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and to assist WMO Members in discovering, accessing, and utilizing hydrologic data from different sources.

This standard is also intended to support the need for governance and guidance by national and international authorities. Aspects of the standard that support this goal are 1) canonical form, 2) implementation neutrality, 3) conformity to internationally recognized geographic information standards, and use of semantics inferred from terminology endorsed by the WMO and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

[big]*vi.  Relationship to the OGC® Abstract Specification*

The HY_Features conceptual model, described in this standard, references
concepts defined in the OGC Abstract Specification (OGC AS). Conformance
to the OGC AS may be achieved via specialization of the relevant concept.
An example of this kind of conformance is a geographic feature specialization
that carries specific hydrologic feature attributes and associations. Conformance
may also be achieved by asserting a correspondence or analogy between HY_Features 
concepts and OGC AS concepts. For example, the river reference system for
referencing positions along a nominal flowpath corresponds to linear referencing
along any linear feature element.
This standard requires no changes to the current version of the OpenGIS Abstract
Specification.
