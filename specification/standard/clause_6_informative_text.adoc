=== The abstract idea of the hydrology phenomenon

Processes that continuously deplete and replenish water resources cause or result in a wide range of phenomena that are the subject of monitoring, modeling and reporting in hydrology and related sciences. These distinctly named or otherwise uniquely identified real-world hydrologic phenomena are conceptualized and referred to as hydrologic features in this standard. This standard applies to data and data products that represent these hydrologically defined features.

Water is moving from the atmosphere to the Earth and back to the atmosphere due to the processes forming the Water Cycle (link:#figure2[Figure 2]). Water from precipitation reaching the land surface is accumulated in water bodies occupying empty space on the land surface or in water bearing formations of soil and rock. Excess water overflows these formations and is driven downhill by gravity. Water flowing over soil or rock causes erosion to occur. This erosion tends to concentrate flowing water into water bodies that flow downhill using a connecting system of channels intersecting other water bodies along their way to a common outlet, conceptualized as a potentially complex outfall feature.

Looking back upstream from the outfall, the corresponding catchment feature can be described as a main linear flowpath feature, an areal feature, a boundary feature that encompasses the drained area, a network of water body features, a network of channel features, or a network of hydrometric station features, all representing the catchment. The concepts and terminology used in the preceding sentences form the conceptual and semantic basis for this standard.

As described above, the most general abstraction of the hydrology phenomenon is the catchment. A catchment is a recognized unit of study where hydrologic processes form physiographic features that are realized in various data products. In this specification, the term realization is used to imply that a catchment is recognized and identified for the purpose of referencing it by name or within a topology of other catchments. The term representation is used where geometry is used to represent a catchment's physical features. Using these definitions, we can say that a catchment is an unrealized conceptual feature that can be realized by features for use in topological networks and features with explicit geometry.

Depending on application and scale, the same catchment may be realized in many different ways. The following describe different examples where this multiple realization concept is important:

- The most typical example is that scaling a map-visualization up or down leads to multiple more or less detailed representations of the same realized hydrologic feature.
- Analyses and reports from various disciplines reference differing spatial representations of the same conceptual catchment.
- Some applications require cartographic (visual) representations while others are focused on topological (network connectivity) realizations only (link:#figure3[Figure 3]).
- A catchment may be represented geometrically by streamlines, drainage area or the bounding polygon, or realized topologically as a face, edge, and/or nodes.

Catchments can be realized as geographic streams and outfalls, simplified geographic stream representations, schematics of streams and outfalls, an aggregate of catchments, simplified representations of catchment aggregates, or schematics showing how catchments relate.

The concept of catchment used in this standard is that it is described physically as illustrated above. It can also be described as the recognized unit of water resources assessment and management across administrative jurisdictions. In multi-stakeholder collaboration and cross-domain research projects, the catchment is recognized as a shared monitoring and reporting unit, in that monitoring stations are usually on a river in a recognized catchment, attributes of the catchment may be in reference to its geometry, and its inflow and outflow are network locations connecting it to other catchments in a topology. Examples of catchments include "Hydrologic Unit Code" (HUC) catchments defined by the U.S. Geological Survey for research and regulatory data systems to use as a reference [7] and "River Basin Districts" of the European Water Framework Directive [1].
