=== The abstract idea of the hydrology phenomenon

Processes that continuously deplete and replenish water resources cause or result in a wide range of phenomena that are the subject of monitoring, modeling and reporting in hydrology and related sciences. These distinctly named or otherwise uniquely identified real-world hydrologic phenomena are conceptualized and referred to as hydrologic features in this standard. This standard applies to data and data products that represent these hydrologically defined features.

Water is moving from the atmosphere to the Earth and back to the atmosphere due to the processes forming the Water Cycle (link:#figure2[Figure 2]). Water from precipitation reaching the land surface is accumulated in water bodies occupying empty space on the land surface or in water bearing formations of soil and rock. Excess water overflows these formations and is driven downhill by gravity. Water flowing over soil or rock causes erosion to occur. This erosion tends to concentrate flowing water into water bodies that flow downhill using a connecting system of channels intersecting other water bodies along their way to a common outlet, conceptualized as a potentially complex outfall feature.

Looking back upstream from the outfall, the corresponding catchment feature can be described as a main linear flowpath feature, an areal feature, a boundary feature that encompasses the drained area, a network of water body features, a network of channel features, or a network of hydrometric station features, all representing the catchment. The concepts and terminology used in the preceding sentences form the conceptual and semantic basis for this standard.

As described above, the most general abstraction of the hydrology phenomenon is the catchment. A catchment is a recognized unit of study where hydrologic processes form physiographic features that are realized in various data products. In this specification, the term realization is used to imply that a catchment is recognized and identified for the purpose of referencing it by name or within a topology of other catchments. The term representation is used where geometry is used to represent a catchment's physical features. Using these definitions, we can say that a catchment is an unrealized conceptual feature that can be realized by features for use in topological networks and features with explicit geometry.

Depending on application and scale, the same catchment may be realized in many different ways. The following describe different examples where this multiple realization concept is important:

- The most typical example is that scaling a map-visualization up or down leads to multiple more or less detailed representations of the same realized hydrologic feature.
- Analyses and reports from various disciplines reference differing spatial representations of the same conceptual catchment.
- Some applications require cartographic (visual) representations while others are focused on topological (network connectivity) realizations only (link:#figure3[Figure 3]).
- A catchment may be represented geometrically by streamlines, drainage area or the bounding polygon, or realized topologically as a face, edge, and/or nodes.

Catchments can be realized as geographic streams and outfalls, simplified geographic stream representations, schematics of streams and outfalls, an aggregate of catchments, simplified representations of catchment aggregates, or schematics showing how catchments relate.

The concept of catchment used in this standard is that it is described physically as illustrated above. It can also be described as the recognized unit of water resources assessment and management across administrative jurisdictions. In multi-stakeholder collaboration and cross-domain research projects, the catchment is recognized as a shared monitoring and reporting unit, in that monitoring stations are usually on a river in a recognized catchment, attributes of the catchment may be in reference to its geometry, and its inflow and outflow are network locations connecting it to other catchments in a topology. Examples of catchments include "Hydrologic Unit Code" (HUC) catchments defined by the U.S. Geological Survey for research and regulatory data systems to use as a reference [7] and "River Basin Districts" of the European Water Framework Directive [1].

=== Catchment and realizations of the catchment concept

The core concept of the HY_Features model is that a study of the Hydrology phenomenon will reference common conceptual entities of the real world such as catchment, water body, channel, or stream gaging site, through the use of features according to a specific model (as per ISO 19109 General Feature Model). Depending on the field of study or application, complex hydrology phenomenon features may be realized in many ways. This leads to the idea that each study of a catchment may portray it in a particular way leading to multiple realizations of the same conceptual entity.

Across hydrologic disciplines the concept of catchment defined in this standard is the recognized conceptual unit of study where hydrologic processes take place. Catchment boundary, catchment area, and linear flowpath are the most common geometric realizations of a catchment, and are widely used to create cartographic views of a catchment. Map layers that separately visualize the hydrographic network of water bodies (typically as blue lines for small rivers and blue polygons for larger rivers and lakes) and of channels (typically lines displaying a drainage pattern indicating the path flow may follow), or a network of hydrometric monitoring stations, are usually combined to portray the represented catchment as a whole. Such cartographic data products are usually exposed in map services, while the water body or channel features are provided with an appropriate geometry and location usually in features services. To illustrate these ideas, link:#figure4[Figure 4] shows an idealized watershed with different graphical representations highlighted.

Each of these graphical realizations is a different way of looking at the catchment and its interaction with other features. It is generally not possible to inspect a particular realization and understand all characteristics of the catchment because different types of features are often realized using identical data models. For example, a map showing a set of catchment polygons may display an aggregate of sub-catchments, or a collection of catchment polygons that overlap each other occupying the same space. In order to understand what catchment concept is being realized, the more detailed information about their type and role in a data model needs to be declared. These relationships and potential constraints may be declared between a high-order catchment and the catchments generally nested therein, or between an aggregate network of catchments that encompasses nested catchments without any overlap, or the upstream-downstream direction of flow for a set of catchment polygons.

In some cases, a catchment may be realized as an identified feature without specified geometry that takes part in a topological network of catchments. This is common, for example, in data systems supporting hydrologic modeling. Catchment attributes needed to parameterize a model may be generated using various geospatial data sets, but the geometric information is not necessary for the actual modelling. In applications like this, and in data systems supporting such applications, a catchment can be realized by an identifier, attributes, and topological connections that are not necessarily the same as would be implied by geometric representation of a catchment. That is, while a catchment has a geometric representation that is an area, which would imply it is a topological face, the catchment can have a non-geometric realization that is a topological edge which conveys flow from inflow to outflow. This flexibility, where a realization of a catchment feature does not need to have an explicit geometric representation allows a decoupling of visual and conceptual concerns with the ability to explicitly link data products that would not otherwise be easily related.
