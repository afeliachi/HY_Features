# OGC WaterML 2: Part 3 - Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) - Conceptual Model

**The specification can be [accessed here: http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html)**  

[HY\_Features](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html) has been published as part of the [WaterML2 suite](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/waterml) of standards. More information about the WaterML2 standards can be found on the [Hydrology Domain Working Group wiki](https://external.opengeospatial.org/twiki_public/HydrologyDWG/WebHome)  

### More info about HY\_Features

A primer presentation on HY\_Features is [available here.](http://opengeospatial.github.io/HY_Features/HY_Features_primer/HY_Features_Primer.html)  

An html view of the HY\_Features UML model is available on this web page. It is available in several packages [described in detail in section 7.1 of the specification](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html#_the_hy_features_conceptual_model). These html pages contain UML diagrams used in the HY\_Features specification and hyperlinked descriptive content for classes and relations included in the model.
